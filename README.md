# matlab_student_database
This is my MATLAB Midterm Project that requires the creation and analysis of a student database.
Within this Repository you will find a Database of six students, and three custom graphics that will assist the user in understanding the data.
The code is formatted so that more stduents can be added with relatove ease, and with additions, the cooresponding graphics will also update.
This code is free to use for anyone else, and I hope it to be helpful to those who may need to organize data pertaining to people or students. 
If you have any questions about the code, or in general, please contact me at ethan.warminsky@gmail.com!
